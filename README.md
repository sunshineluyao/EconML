# EconML Notebooks: Machine Learning Applications in Economics

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of **machine learning (ML)** techniques in various economic applications. The notebooks provide a practical guide to applying ML methods for **explanation**, **prediction**, **causal inference**, **optimization**, and explore issues in **AI governance and ethics** within economic contexts.

## Key Areas Covered

### 1. **Explanation**
   - Machine learning models are often seen as "black boxes." These notebooks demonstrate how to use tools like **SHAP values**, **partial dependence plots (PDPs)**, and **feature importance** to interpret ML model predictions.
   - **Why it matters**: Understanding how models arrive at their predictions is crucial in economics, where decisions often rely on transparency and interpretability.

### 2. **Prediction**
   - Leverage ML models such as **Random Forests**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **Neural Networks** for predicting economic variables.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Forecasting **GDP growth**, **inflation**, or **unemployment rates**.
     - Predicting **credit default** or **consumer behavior**.
   - **Why it matters**: Accurate predictions can guide policymakers and businesses in making data-driven decisions.

### 3. **Causal Inference**
   - Demonstrates advanced techniques like **Double Machine Learning (DML)**, **Instrumental Variables (IV)**, and **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects**.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Estimating the impact of policy interventions (e.g., the effect of subsidies on job creation).
     - Understanding treatment effects in healthcare or education (e.g., the impact of financial aid on student performance).
   - **Why it matters**: Unlike prediction, causal inference focuses on understanding cause-and-effect relationships, which is essential for designing effective policies.

### 4. **Optimization**
   - Showcases the use of ML in solving optimization problems such as **resource allocation**, **portfolio optimization**, and **supply chain optimization**.
   - **Techniques**: Combines ML models with optimization algorithms like **linear programming**, **gradient descent**, and **reinforcement learning**.
   - **Why it matters**: Optimization helps in efficiently allocating resources, maximizing profits, or minimizing costs in economic and business settings.

### 5. **AI Governance and Ethics**
   - Explores ethical considerations and governance frameworks for deploying AI in economic decision-making.
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - **Bias and Fairness**: Techniques to detect and mitigate biases in ML models.
     - **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensuring AI systems are interpretable and accountable.
     - **Privacy and Data Security**: Handling sensitive economic data responsibly.
   - **Why it matters**: Ensures that AI and ML systems are used responsibly, aligning with societal values and legal frameworks.
